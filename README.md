## Functional Documentation

These are the features supported by our platforms (Web, Desktop and iOS). Their ordering or visual representation differs slightly between the platforms to accomodate for their particularities.

### User Accounts
The app supports performing transactions anonymously or through an account which can be created and logged into through the app by assigning to each user a unique username.

### Recording a Transaction
Adding a transaction is done by specifying the USD and LBP amounts, the direction of the transaction as well as if it is directed to a specific user (this option is only available when the user is logged in).

### Exchange Rates
See the USD/LBP exchange rates (how much LBP to buy/sell 1 USD) averaged over the last three days.

### Statistics
The statistics section displays a graph that plots the daily average exchange USD/LBP rates over variable ranges (30, 60 or 90 days) as well as detailed statistics which display the max, average and standard devitation of both exchange rates from the last 30 days as well as a table that lists all past transactions and who they were exchanged with in case they were exchanged between users. The table can only be filtered to only show transactions done between users.

### Exchange Rate Calculator
The calculator allows the user to convert a specific amount of a given currency (LBP or USD) to the other at the exchange rate shown on the main view (USD/LBP exchange rates averaged over the last three days).
