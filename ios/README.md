# iOS Platform

## How to Run
- Xcode 12 or later to build the project
- Simulator or physical iPhone device running iOS 14.0 or later

## Technologies Used
- UIKit is used to build the GUI components
- [Charts](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts) is used for the exchange rate multi-line graph
- Swift Package Manager (SPM) for the Charts dependency

The backend component also needs to be running locally since it currently isn't deployed, refer to the corresponding README for running instructions.
